## Creating directories

We now know how to explore files and directories,
but how do we create them in the first place?

In this episode we will learn about creating and moving files and directories,
using the `exercise-data/writing` directory as an example.

### Step one: see where we are and what we already have

We should still be in the `shell-lesson-data` directory on the Desktop,
which we can check using:

```bash
$ pwd
```

```output
/Users/nelle/Desktop/shell-lesson-data
```

Next we'll move to the `exercise-data/writing` directory and see what it contains:

```bash
$ cd exercise-data/writing/
$ ls
```

```output
haiku.txt  LittleWomen.txt
```

:::{.infobox}
::::{.infobox-header}
What's In A Name?
::::
::::{.exercise-container}

These two files are named 'something dot
something'. These two files use the extension
`.txt`.  This is just a convention; we can call a file `mythesis` or
almost anything else we want. However, most people use two-part names
most of the time to help them (and their programs) tell different kinds
of files apart. The second part of such a name is called the
**filename extension** and indicates
what type of data the file holds: `.txt` signals a plain text file, `.pdf`
indicates a PDF document, `.cfg` is a configuration file, `.png` is a PNG image, and so on.

This is just a convention, albeit an important one. Files merely contain
bytes; it's up to us and our programs to interpret those bytes
according to the rules for plain text files, PDF documents, configuration
files, images, and so on.

Naming a PNG image of a whale as `whale.mp3` doesn't somehow
magically turn it into a recording of whale song, though it *might*
cause the operating system to associate the file with a music player
program. In this case, if someone double-clicked `whale.mp3` in a file
explorer program, the music player will automatically (and erroneously)
attempt to open the `whale.mp3` file.

From the old days, file extensions use three characters.
Since before you were born, you were no longer bound by this restriction. Make you extensions
as long as you wish, but keep them sensible.

### Create a directory

Directories can be created using the command `mkdir`,
which stands for `make directory`. Its argument is the name of the desired directory.


Let's create a new directory called `thesis` using the command `mkdir thesis`
(which has no output):

```bash
$ mkdir thesis
```

Since `thesis` is a relative path
(i.e., does not have a leading slash, like `/what/ever/thesis`),
the new directory is created in the current working directory:

```bash
$ ls -F
```

```output
haiku.txt  LittleWomen.txt  thesis/
```

Since we've just created the `thesis` directory, there's nothing in it yet:

```bash
$ ls thesis
```

Note that `mkdir` is not limited to creating single directories one at a time.
The `-p` option allows `mkdir` to create a directory with nested subdirectories
in a single operation:

```bash
$ mkdir -p ../project/data ../project/results
```

The `-R` option to the `ls` command will list all nested subdirectories within a directory.
Let's use `ls -FR` to recursively list the new directory hierarchy we just created in the
`project` directory:

```bash
$ ls -FR ../project
```

```output
../project/:
data/  results/

../project/data:

../project/results:
```

:::{.infobox}
::::{.infobox-header}
Two ways of doing the same thing
::::
::::{.exercise-container}

Using the shell to create a directory is no different than using a graphical file manager (such as Windows File Explorer).
If you open the current directory using your operating system's graphical file manager,
the `thesis` directory will appear there too.
While the shell and the file explorer are two different ways of interacting with the files,
the files and directories themselves are the same.

::::
:::

:::{.infobox}
::::{.infobox-header}
Good names for files and directories
::::
::::{.exercise-container}

Complicated names of files and directories can make your life painful
when working on the command line. Here we provide a few useful
tips for the names of your files and directories.

1. Don't use spaces.

Spaces can make a name more meaningful,
but since spaces are used to separate arguments on the command line
it is better to avoid them in names of files and directories.
You can use `-` or `_` instead (e.g. `north-pacific-gyre/` rather than `north pacific gyre/`).
To test this out, try typing `mkdir north pacific gyre` and see what directory (or directories!)
are made when you check with `ls -F`.

2. Don't begin the name with `-` (dash).

Commands treat strings starting with `-` as options. 

3. Stick with letters, numbers, `.` (period or 'full stop'), and `_` (underscore).

Many other characters have special meanings on the command line.
We will learn about some of these during this lesson.
There are special characters that can cause your command to not work as
expected and can even result in data loss.

If you need to refer to names of files or directories that have spaces
or other special characters, you should surround the name in single
[quotes](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Quoting.html) (`''`).

4. Be consistent with upper and lower case characters in file names. 

Some operating systems are 'case sensitive' 
(they make distrinction between upper case and lower case character). Some do not.
Some programming languages are case sensitive, and some are not. Assume that everything
is case sensitive, and stick to one convention to avoid confusion and make everthing easier on the eye.

`myAwesomeFile.data` and `myawesomefile.data` do not play well together.

### Create a text file

Let's change our working directory to `thesis` using `cd`,
then run a text editor called Nano to create a file called `draft.txt`:

```bash
$ cd thesis
$ nano draft.txt
```

:::{.infobox}
::::{.infobox-header}
Which Editor?
::::
::::{.exercise-container}

When we say, '`nano` is a text editor' we really do mean 'text'. It can
only work with plain character data, not tables, images, or any other
content, not can you move the cursor around by clicking on it with your mouse pointer.
The cursor can be moved with the arrow keys, `[home]`, `[end]`, `[page up]` and `[page down]`.

We use it in examples because it is one of the
least complex text editors. However, because of this trait, it may
not be powerful enough or flexible enough for the work you need to do
after this workshop. On Unix systems (such as Linux and macOS),
many programmers use [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) or
[Vim](https://www.vim.org/) (both of which require more time to learn),
or a graphical editor such as [Gedit](https://projects.gnome.org/gedit/),
[Geany](https://geany.org/)
or [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (or the equally good open source variant without telemetry [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/)). On Windows, you may wish to
use [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/), [Atom](https://atom-editor.cc/), or VSCode/VSCodium.  Windows also has a built-in
editor called `notepad` that can be run from the command line in the same
way as `nano` for the purposes of this lesson.

No matter what editor you use, you will need to know where it searches
for and saves files. If you start it from the shell, it will (probably)
use your current working directory as its default location. If you use
your computer's start menu, it may want to save files in your Desktop or
Documents directory instead. You can change this by navigating to
another directory the first time you 'Save As...'

::::
:::

Let's type in a few lines of text.

![](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/fig/nano-screenshot.png){alt="screenshot of nano text editor in action with the text It's not publish or perish any more, it's share and thrive"}

Once we're happy with our text, we can press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>\+<kbd>O</kbd>
(press the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> or <kbd>Control</kbd> key and, while
holding it down, press the <kbd>O</kbd> key) to write our data to disk. We will be asked
to provide a name for the file that will contain our text. Press <kbd>Return</kbd> to accept
the suggested default of `draft.txt`.

Once our file is saved, we can use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>\+<kbd>X</kbd> to quit the editor and
return to the shell.

:::{.infobox}
::::{.infobox-header}
Control, Ctrl, or ^ Key
::::
::::{.exercise-container}

The Control key is also called the 'Ctrl' key. There are various ways
in which using the Control key may be described. For example, you may
see an instruction to press the <kbd>Control</kbd> key and, while holding it down,
press the <kbd>X</kbd> key, described as any of:

- `Control-X`
- `Control+X`
- `Ctrl-X`
- `Ctrl+X`
- `^X`
- `C-x`

In nano, along the bottom of the screen you'll see `^G Get Help ^O WriteOut`.
This means that you can use `Control-G` to get help and `Control-O` to save your
file.

::::
:::

`nano` doesn't leave any output on the screen after it exits,
but `ls` now shows that we have created a file called `draft.txt`:

```bash
$ ls
```

```output
draft.txt
```

And we can see the content of the file with the command `cat` (which stands for 'concatenate') 
which is great for displaying the content of small files:

```bash
$ cat draft.txt
```

```output
It's  not "publish or perish" any more,
it's "share and thrive".
```


## Moving files and directories

Return to the `shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/writing` directory,

```bash
$ cd ~/Desktop/shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/writing
```

In our `thesis` directory we have a file `draft.txt`
which isn't a particularly informative name.
The name of the file can be changed with the command `mv`,
which is short for 'move'.
It is our first command that has two arguments.

```bash
$ mv [source] [destination]
```

In this case,
we're moving `thesis/draft.txt` to `thesis/quotes.txt`,
which has the same effect as renaming the file.


```bash
$ mv thesis/draft.txt thesis/quotes.txt
```

Sure enough,
`ls` shows us that `thesis` now contains one file called `quotes.txt`:

```bash
$ ls thesis
```

```output
quotes.txt
```

One must be careful when specifying the target file name, since `mv` will
silently overwrite any existing file with the same name, which could
lead to data loss. By default, `mv` will not ask for confirmation before overwriting files.
However, an additional option, `mv -i` (or `mv --interactive`), will cause `mv` to request
such confirmation.

Note that `mv` also works on directories.

Let's move `quotes.txt` into the current working directory.
We use `mv` once again,
but this time we'll use just the name of a directory as the second argument
to tell `mv` that we want to keep the filename
but put the file somewhere new.
(This is why the command is called 'move'.)
In this case,
the directory name we use is the special directory name `.` that we mentioned earlier.

```bash
$ mv thesis/quotes.txt .
```

The effect is to move the file from the directory it was in to the current working directory.
`ls` now shows us that `thesis` is empty:

```bash
$ ls thesis
```

```output
$
```

Alternatively, we can confirm the file `quotes.txt` is no longer present in the `thesis` directory
by explicitly trying to list it:

```bash
$ ls thesis/quotes.txt
```

```error
ls: cannot access 'thesis/quotes.txt': No such file or directory
```

`ls` with a filename or directory as an argument only lists the requested file or directory.
If the file given as the argument doesn't exist, the shell returns an error as we saw above.
We can use this to see that `quotes.txt` is now present in our current directory:

```bash
$ ls quotes.txt
```

```output
quotes.txt
```

Moving Files to a new directory

::::
::::{.exercise-container}
After running the following commands,
Nelle realizes that she put the files `sucrose.dat` and `maltose.dat` into the wrong directory.
The files should have been placed in the `raw` directory.

```bash
$ ls -F
 analyzed/ raw/
$ ls -F analyzed
fructose.dat glucose.dat maltose.dat sucrose.dat
$ cd analyzed
```

Fill in the blanks to move these files to the `raw/` directory
(i.e. the one she forgot to put them in)

```bash
$ mv sucrose.dat maltose.dat ____/____
```

:::{.answer}

```bash
$ mv sucrose.dat maltose.dat ../raw
```

Recall that `..` refers to the parent directory (i.e. one above the current directory)
and that `.` refers to the current directory.

:::
::::
:::

## Copying files and directories

The `cp` command works very much like `mv`,
except it copies a file instead of moving it.
We can check that it did the right thing using `ls`
with two paths as arguments --- like most Unix commands,
`ls` can be given multiple paths at once:

```bash
$ cp quotes.txt thesis/quotations.txt
$ ls quotes.txt thesis/quotations.txt
```

```output
quotes.txt   thesis/quotations.txt
```

We can also copy a directory and all its contents by using the
[recursive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion) option `-r`,
e.g. to back up a directory:

```bash
$ cp -r thesis thesis_backup
```

We can check the result by listing the contents of both the `thesis` and `thesis_backup` directory:

```bash
$ ls thesis thesis_backup
```

```output
thesis:
quotations.txt

thesis_backup:
quotations.txt
```

It is important to include the `-r` flag. If you want to copy a directory and you omit this option
you will see a message that the directory has been omitted because `-r not specified`.

``` bash
$ cp thesis thesis_backup
cp: -r not specified; omitting directory 'thesis'
```

Renaming Files
::::
::::{.exercise-container}

Suppose that you created a plain-text file in your current directory to contain a list of the
statistical tests you will need to do to analyze your data, and named it `statstics.txt`

After creating and saving this file you realize you misspelled the filename! You want to
correct the mistake, which of the following commands could you use to do so?

1. `cp statstics.txt statistics.txt`
2. `mv statstics.txt statistics.txt`
3. `mv statstics.txt .`
4. `cp statstics.txt .`

:::{.answer}

1. No.  While this would create a file with the correct name,
  the incorrectly named file still exists in the directory
  and would need to be deleted.
2. Yes, this would work to rename the file.
3. No, the period(.) indicates where to move the file, but does not provide a new file name;
  identical file names
  cannot be created.
4. No, the period(.) indicates where to copy the file, but does not provide a new file name;
  identical file names cannot be created.

What is the output of the closing `ls` command in the sequence shown below?

```bash

```output

```

```bash

```

```output
proteins.dat
```

```bash
$ mkdir recombined
$ mv proteins.dat recombined/
$ cp recombined/proteins.dat ../proteins-saved.dat
$ ls
```

1. `proteins-saved.dat recombined`
2. `recombined`
3. `proteins.dat recombined`
4. `proteins-saved.dat`

:::{.answer}

We start in the `/Users/nelle/data` directory, and create a new directory called `recombined`.
The second line moves (`mv`) the file `proteins.dat` to the new directory (`recombined`).
The third line makes a copy of the file we just moved.
The tricky part here is where the file was copied to.
Recall that `..` means 'go up a level', so the copied file is now in `/Users/nelle`.
Notice that `..` is interpreted with respect to the current working
directory, **not** with respect to the location of the file being copied.
So, the only thing that will show using ls (in `/Users/nelle/data`) is the recombined directory.

1. No, see explanation above.  `proteins-saved.dat` is located at `/Users/nelle`
2. Yes
3. No, see explanation above.  `proteins.dat` is located at `/Users/nelle/data/recombined`
4. No, see explanation above.  `proteins-saved.dat` is located at `/Users/nelle`

## Removing files and directories

Returning to the `shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/writing` directory,
let's tidy up this directory by removing the `quotes.txt` file we created.
The Unix command we'll use for this is `rm` (short for 'remove'):

```bash
$ rm quotes.txt
```

We can confirm the file has gone using `ls`:

```bash
$ ls quotes.txt
```

```error
ls: cannot access 'quotes.txt': No such file or directory
```

:::{.infobox}
::::{.infobox-header}
Deleting Is Forever
::::
::::{.exercise-container}

The Unix shell doesn't have a trash bin that we can recover deleted
files from (though most graphical interfaces to Unix do).  Instead,
when we delete files, they are unlinked from the file system so that
their storage space on disk can be recycled. Tools for finding and
recovering deleted files do exist, but there's no guarantee they'll
work in any particular situation, since the computer may recycle the
file's disk space right away.

::::
:::

:::{.exercise}
::::{.exercise-header}
Using `rm` Safely
::::
::::{.exercise-container}

What happens when we execute `rm -i thesis_backup/quotations.txt`?  
Why would we want this protection when using `rm`?

:::{.answer}

```output
rm: remove regular file 'thesis_backup/quotations.txt'? y
```

The `-i` option will prompt before (every) removal (use <kbd>Y</kbd> to confirm deletion
or <kbd>N</kbd> to keep the file).
The Unix shell doesn't have a trash bin, so all the files removed will disappear forever.
By using the `-i` option, we have the chance to check that we are deleting only the files
that we want to remove.

:::
::::
:::


If we try to remove the `thesis` directory using `rm thesis`,
we get an error message:

```bash
$ rm thesis
```

```error
rm: cannot remove 'thesis': Is a directory
```

This happens because `rm` by default only works on files, not directories.

`rm` can remove a directory *and all its contents* if we use the
recursive option `-r`, and it will do so *without any confirmation prompts*:

```bash
$ rm -r thesis
```

Given that there is no way to retrieve files deleted using the shell,
`rm -r` *should be used with great caution*
(you might consider adding the interactive option `rm -r -i`).

## Operations with multiple files and directories

Often one needs to copy or move several files at once.
This can be done by providing a list of individual filenames,
or specifying a naming pattern using wildcards. Wildcards are
special characters that can be used to represent unknown characters
or sets of characters when navigating the Unix file system.

:::{.exercise}
::::{.exercise-header}
Copy with Multiple Filenames
::::
::::{.exercise-container}

For this exercise, you can test the commands in the `shell-lesson-data/exercise-data` directory.

In the example below, what does `cp` do when given several filenames and a directory name?

```bash
$ mkdir backup
$ cp creatures/minotaur.dat creatures/unicorn.dat backup/
```

In the example below, what does `cp` do when given three or more file names?

```bash
$ cd creatures
$ ls -F
```

```output
basilisk.dat  minotaur.dat  unicorn.dat
```

```bash
$ cp minotaur.dat unicorn.dat basilisk.dat
```

:::{.answer}

If given more than one file name followed by a directory name
(i.e. the destination directory must be the last argument),
`cp` copies the files to the named directory.

If given three file names, `cp` throws an error such as the one below,
because it is expecting a directory name as the last argument.

```error
cp: target 'basilisk.dat' is not a directory
```

::::
:::

### Using wildcards for accessing multiple files at once

:::{.infobox}
::::{.infobox-header}
Wildcards
::::
::::{.exercise-container}

`*` is a **wildcard**, which represents zero or more other characters.
Let's consider the `shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/alkanes` directory:
`*.pdb` represents `ethane.pdb`, `propane.pdb`, and every
file that ends with '.pdb'. On the other hand, `p*.pdb` only represents
`pentane.pdb` and `propane.pdb`, because the 'p' at the front can only
represent filenames that begin with the letter 'p'.

`?` is also a wildcard, but it represents exactly one character.
So `?ethane.pdb` could represent `methane.pdb` whereas
`*ethane.pdb` represents both `ethane.pdb` and `methane.pdb`.

Wildcards can be used in combination with each other. For example,
`???ane.pdb` indicates three characters followed by `ane.pdb`,
giving `cubane.pdb  ethane.pdb  octane.pdb`.

When the shell sees a wildcard, it expands the wildcard to create a
list of matching filenames *before* running the preceding command.
As an exception, if a wildcard expression does not match
any file, Bash will pass the expression as an argument to the command
as it is. For example, typing `ls *.pdf` in the `alkanes` directory
(which contains only files with names ending with `.pdb`) results in
an error message that there is no file called `*.pdf`.
However, generally commands like `wc` and `ls` see the lists of
file names matching these expressions, but not the wildcards
themselves. It is the shell, not the other programs, that expands
the wildcards.

::::
:::


:::{.exercise}
::::{.exercise-header}
List filenames matching a pattern
::::
::::{.exercise-container}

Navigate into the `alkanes` directory. Which `ls` command(s) will
produce this output?

`ethane.pdb   methane.pdb`

1. `ls *t*ane.pdb`
2. `ls *t?ne.*`
3. `ls *t??ne.pdb`
4. `ls ethane.*`

:::{.answer}

The solution is `3.`

`1.` shows all files whose names contain zero or more characters (`*`)
followed by the letter `t`,
then zero or more characters (`*`) followed by `ane.pdb`.
This gives `ethane.pdb  methane.pdb  octane.pdb  pentane.pdb`.

`2.` shows all files whose names start with zero or more characters (`*`) followed by
the letter `t`,
then a single character (`?`), then `ne.` followed by zero or more characters (`*`).
This will give us `octane.pdb` and `pentane.pdb` but doesn't match anything
which ends in `thane.pdb`.

`3.` fixes the problems of option 2 by matching two characters (`??`) between `t` and `ne`.
This is the solution.

`4.` only shows files starting with `ethane.`.

Organizing Directories and Files
::::
::::{.exercise-container}

Jamie is working on a project, and she sees that her files aren't very well
organized:

```bash
$ ls -F
```

```output
analyzed/  fructose.dat    raw/   sucrose.dat
```

The `fructose.dat` and `sucrose.dat` files contain output from her data
analysis. What command(s) covered in this lesson does she need to run
so that the following commands will produce the output shown?

```bash
$ ls -F
```

```output
analyzed/   raw/
```

```bash
$ ls analyzed
```

```output
fructose.dat    sucrose.dat
```

:::{.answer}

```bash
mv *.dat analyzed
```

Nelle needs to move her files `fructose.dat` and `sucrose.dat` to the `analyzed` directory.
The shell will expand \*.dat to match all .dat files in the current directory.
The `mv` command then moves the list of .dat files to the 'analyzed' directory.

Reproduce a directory structure
::::
::::{.exercise-container}

You're starting a new experiment and would like to duplicate the directory
structure from your previous experiment so you can add new data.

Assume that the previous experiment is in a directory called `2016-05-18`,
which contains a `data` directory that in turn contains directories named `raw` and
`processed` that contain data files.  The goal is to copy the directory structure
of the `2016-05-18` directory into a directory called `2016-05-20`
so that your final directory structure looks like this:

```output
2016-05-20/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ data
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ processed
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ raw
```

Which of the following set of commands would achieve this objective?
What would the other commands do?

```bash
$ mkdir 2016-05-20
$ mkdir 2016-05-20/data
$ mkdir 2016-05-20/data/processed
$ mkdir 2016-05-20/data/raw
```

```bash
$ mkdir 2016-05-20
$ cd 2016-05-20
$ mkdir data
$ cd data
$ mkdir raw processed
```

```bash
$ mkdir 2016-05-20/data/raw
$ mkdir 2016-05-20/data/processed
```

```bash
$ mkdir -p 2016-05-20/data/raw
$ mkdir -p 2016-05-20/data/processed
```

```bash
$ mkdir 2016-05-20
$ cd 2016-05-20
$ mkdir data
$ mkdir raw processed
```

:::{.answer}

The first two sets of commands achieve this objective.
The first set uses relative paths to create the top-level directory before
the subdirectories.

The third set of commands will give an error because the default behavior of `mkdir`
won't create a subdirectory of a non-existent directory:
the intermediate level directories must be created first.

The fourth set of commands achieve this objective. Remember, the `-p` option,
followed by a path of one or more
directories, will cause `mkdir` to create any intermediate subdirectories as required.

The final set of commands generates the 'raw' and 'processed' directories at the same level
as the 'data' directory.

Key points
::::
::::{.exercise-container}

- `cp [source] [destination]` copies a file.
- `mkdir [path]` creates a new directory.
- `mv [source] [destination]` moves (renames) a file or directory.
- `rm [path]` removes (deletes) a file.
- `*` matches zero or more characters in a filename, so `*.txt` matches all files ending in `.txt`.
- `?` matches any single character in a filename, so `?.txt` matches `a.txt` but not `any.txt`.
- Use of the Control key may be described in many ways, including `Ctrl-X`, `Control-X`, and `^X`.
- The shell does not preserve deleted files in a trash bin: once something is deleted, it's really gone.
- Most files' names are `something.extension`. The extension isn't required, and doesn't guarantee anything, but is normally used to indicate the type of data in the file.
- Depending on the type of work you do, you may need a more powerful text editor than Nano.
